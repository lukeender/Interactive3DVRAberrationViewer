# Interactive3DVRAberrationViewer
This is the code for a project I wrote Summer 2016 at the University of Arizona under Dr. Yuzuru Takashima. It uses the Google cardboard platoform to created an interactive remote head-tracking 3D VR camera viewing platform using two off-the-shelf webcams, a uArm metal robotic arm, an Android phone with a gyroscope, an Arduino Uno, and a computer to control the Uno and cameras. The system was designed to provide this kind of viewing platform for a ray aberration generator to be used as a teaching device. For detailed information about the system itself and how data is processed and transferred, please see the document "Description.pdf" in the root direction of the project. To read more about how to set the system up, please see the "documentation.txt" in the same directory.
